# Python Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small Python programs that I created to strengthen my skills and understanding of various core Python concepts. These programs aim to practice and apply Python’s basic syntax, functions, and libraries while achieving useful and fun tasks. Each program focuses on different areas such as user interaction, game development, and handling data.

## Programs Included:
1. **Acronym Generator**: Learn how to extract initials from a string and convert it into an acronym.
2. **Alarm Clock**: A simple clock program that displays the current time, helping me practice working with time and date functions in Python.
3. **Email Slicer**: This program splits an email address into the username and domain, showcasing string manipulation.

4. **Password Generator**: A tool to generate secure passwords, giving an introduction to randomization and handling secure data.
5. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: Implements a simple text-based game with the computer, reinforcing logic and user input handling.
6. **Dice Roll Simulator**: Simulates the roll of a dice for both the user and the computer, demonstrating random number generation.
7. **QR Code Generator**: Generates QR codes for any given URL, working with external libraries such as `qrcode` and `Pillow`.
8. **Animal Quiz Game**: A fun quiz game about animals, teaching how to structure multiple-choice quizzes and handle user input.
9. **BMI Calculator**: A simple program to calculate BMI based on user input, practicing functions and basic arithmetic.
10. **Temperature Converter**: Converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa, illustrating basic conversion logic.
11. **Roman to Decimal Converter**: Converts Roman numerals to decimals, helping me practice logic and basic number operations.

## Learning Goals:
- **Problem Solving**: Each program addresses a unique challenge, allowing me to practice and improve my problem-solving skills in Python.
- **Function Definition and Usage**: I worked on defining functions, understanding arguments, return values, and overall program structure.
- **User Input and Output**: Most of the programs involve taking input from users, processing that data, and displaying results in a user-friendly manner.
- **Libraries and Modules**: I learned how to work with Python’s built-in libraries, such as `random` and `datetime`, as well as external libraries like `qrcode` and `Pillow`.
- **Error Handling**: In some programs, I encountered and handled errors to improve the robustness of the code.

By building and refining these programs, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of Python’s capabilities and learned how to approach coding challenges systematically. This collection not only reflects my growing proficiency in Python but also my commitment to continuous learning.
